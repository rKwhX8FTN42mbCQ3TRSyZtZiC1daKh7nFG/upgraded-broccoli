The most secure way to sign a transaction is to do it locally with a [client library](client-libraries.html). Alternatively, if you run your own `rippled` node you can sign the transaction using the [sign method](sign.html), but this must be done through a trusted and encrypted connection, or through a local (same-machine) connection.

In all cases, note the signed transaction's identifying hash for later.
