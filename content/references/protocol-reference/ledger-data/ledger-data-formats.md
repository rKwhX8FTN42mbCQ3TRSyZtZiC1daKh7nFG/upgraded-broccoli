# Ledger Data Formats

Each [ledger version](ledgers.html) in the XRP Ledger is made up of three parts:

- **[Ledger Header](ledger-header.html)**: Metadata about this ledger version itself.
- **[Transaction Set](transaction-formats.html)**: All the transactions that were executed to create this ledger version.
- **[State Data](ledger-object-types.html)**: The complete record of objects representing accounts, settings, and balances as of this ledger version. (This is also called the "account state".)
